## run the project
### Back-End

First you need to update composer

```
composer update
```
Then create a **`database`** named **`malek`** and run:

Remember that **`.env`** is not ignored
```
php artisan migrate
```
And leave it open
### Front-End

You need install npm first:

```
npm install
```
If you faced an error for **`Laravel-vite-plugin`** install with this command:

```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
When installation is done run as dev

```
npm run dev
```

Now you have **`Localhost:3000`** for front-end and **`Localhost:8000`**
for our laravel application.
